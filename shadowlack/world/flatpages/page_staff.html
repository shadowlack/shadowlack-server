<p>A simple reference on how Shadowlack's staff should act when faced with conflicts.</p>

<p>Salutations, and welcome to the Staff Handbook. This guide is intended to aid Shadowlack's (the "Site") staff in
  learning more about their position and duties while acting on the Site's behalf. It is available as a public document
  all our players to maintain transparency.</p>

<p>Since our environment is ever-changing, it would be foolish to think that everything written within this Handbook
  should be set in stone. Therefore, while this advice and guidelines are applicable now, they will be subject to
  revisions.</p>

<p>This Site operates on various rules and guidelines. It is these guidelines that help prevent the Site spiralling down
  toward chaos. As a staff member, we assume you are intimately familiar with all of our rules and that you adhere to
  them fully.</p>

<h2>I. Staff Member Conduct</h2>

<p>As a staff member of this Site, you are expected to remember the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Representative</b><br />
    You are considered a representative of our Site. You must also note that as a representative this Site, that your
    actions, or lack of actions on other web sites may reflect your reputation here as well as our Site's image.</li>

  <li><b>Professionalism</b><br />
    Staff members are expected to act in a professional manner. You must be courteous towards other players and your
    fellow staff members. If you do not respect them, they will not respect you. All staff members are expected to act
    with maturity.</li>

  <li><b>Site Rules</b><br />
    Being a staff member is a privilege, not a right. Even though you are a staff member, that does not mean that you
    are above the Site’s regular rules. All staff members must abide by as well as enforce the Site’s rules.</li>

  <li><b>Favouritism</b><br />
    As a staff member, you should not show favouritism towards other players. This means granting individual players
    special privileges or rights. This does not mean that you cannot make friends with players. In fact, you’re
    encouraged to make friends. Try your best to treat everyone equally.</li>

  <li><b>Spreading Gossip and/or Negativity</b><br />
    We do not permit staff members to talk negatively about <u>any</u> player at our Site on our public-facing or
    private staff boards. Problematic players should be brought to the attention of an Administrator and handled
    privately. We will not facilitate the airing of anyone's "dirty laundry."
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>II. Conflict Resolutions</h2>

<p>All sites have their conflicts and we are no exception. It is how we deal with conflict that builds a safe and
  welcoming environment for everyone. All staff members are responsible for maintaining the peace and enforcing the
  rules. Following this are a list of possible player infractions and then the consequences for each. Please note that
  this is not a complete list and that some situations may be handled differently. When in doubt, please contact an
  Administrator.</p>

<p>Private Messages and the chat room are not exempt from the Rules and Regulations laid down by the Site.</p>

<h3>A. Minor Infractions</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Acting as a "Mini-Moderator".</b> When a player see another player breaking the rules, it is only natural for
    them to try and correct the rule-breaker's behaviour. However, that is not their job and can breed unwanted
    resentment if done incorrectly. If you see someone calling another person out for rule-breaking who is not an
    assigned staff member, please remind them that that is a staff member's duty. If they're keen on helping out (as
    people tend to be), let them know that they may contact you privately about rule infractions that they find.</li>

  <li><b>Multiple posts caused by accidentally double posting.</b>
    The board should take care of most of these automagically by itself, but in the event that they do not: merge the
    posts and gently remind the player that they should be editing their original post.</li>

  <li><b>Advertisements to other Play-by-Post games (not listed in our affiliates).</b> Warn player and edit the post to
    remove the game name and link.</li>

  <li><b>Spamming.</b> Warn player. Lock spammy threads and/or posts.</li>

  <li><b>Threads posted in the wrong areas.</b> Move the thread to the appropriate area. Only warn the player if they
    are a repeat offender. Mistakes happen!</li>

  <li><b>Signature is too large.</b> Ask them to please change their signature. You may edit the player's signature if
    you see fit.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Major Infractions</h3>

<p>AKA, the things that will likely get you banned from our Site.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Harassment/racial slurs/gender discrimination/etc.</b> Immediate ban unless you believe the user is being
    unknowingly ignorant or insensitive. Our Site has a large LGBT+ audience and not all "muggles" know when they are
    being insensitive. Try to educate them nicely if you believe this is the case! Posts should be locked for
    documentation and players banned depending upon the severity.</li>

  <li><b>Illegal content in posts (ripped MP3s, hacks, cracks, etc.)</b> Warn player. Posts should be closed and links
    removed. Only repeat offenders should be banned.</li>

  <li><b>Excessive swearing and/or swearing directed at another player.</b> Swearing in general is allowed on the Site,
    so long as it is not maliciously directed toward other players. If it appears to be malicious, warn the player and
    lock the post. Repeat offenders should be banned.</li>

  <li><b>Abuse of the Private Messenger system (PMs).</b> Report the incident immediately to an Administrator.
    Administrators can check the PM logs and deal with the situation as they see fit.</li>

  <li><b>Signature or avatar contains disagreeable or distasteful content.</b> Warn player. Delete their avatar or
    signature if you feel that it is necessary. Repeat offenders will be banned.</li>

  <li><b>Purposely flooding/spamming the boards.</b> Ban player. Delete posts/threads.</li>

  <li><b>Pornography or links to pornography in posts.</b> Ban player. Delete posts/threads.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Issue a Warning</h3>

<p>When giving a player a warning it is best to be as clear and concise as you possibly can. Clearly state which rule(s)
  the player is breaking and remind them that what they are doing isn't acceptable at our Site. If they are a new
  player, extra lenience should be given. <u>Do not</u> yell at the player, or be sarcastic. Your job is to maintain the
  peace and the rules, not start up petty fights or create an unwelcoming and/or hostile environment. If the player
  talks back or otherwise defies your authority, please bring the issue to an Administrator's attention.</p>

<h3>How to Deal With Repeat Offenders</h3>

<p>There will always be a few problematic players at any given Site. If a player has had multiple minor infractions, or
  several major infractions, despite giving them multiple warnings, a temporary or permanent ban may be needed. It is
  best to discuss the problematic player with an Administrator before proceeding with a plan of action.</p>

<h3>Disagreements With Fellow Staff Members</h3>

<p>Yes, us staff are all different people with different faces from different places. There may come a time when you
  disagree with a particular course of action that a staff member has taken. Whatever you do, do not outright confront
  the staff member on the public-facing boards. (Public dissension among the ranks? Yuck.) If you have a problem, either
  discuss it with your fellow staff member privately, discuss it in the non-public staff board, or bring it to the
  attention of an Administrator. You must, under all circumstances, treat fellow staff members with respect, just as you
  would a player.</p>

<h2>III. Removal of Staff Members</h2>

<p>There are several ways that you as a staff member may lose your position:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Consistent breaking of rules or defying authority.</b> You broke multiple rules and despite warnings, it has
    been mutually felt that having you on our staff team would no longer be beneficial to us.</li>

  <li><b>Missing in action (MIA).</b> You took an unexplained prolonged absence. Staff members who have been inactive
    for over a month may be removed from their position.</li>

  <li><b>Multiple haitus periods.</b> It was felt that you took too much time off away from our Site. Although your time
    periods away were explained (life happens!), we believe that someone more active and with more time to spare would
    do better having your position.</li>

  <li><b>Not performing to the Site's standards.</b> We have reviewed your progress, informally or formally, and have
    felt that you just are not performing to the high expectations that we have for our staff members.</li>
</ul>
