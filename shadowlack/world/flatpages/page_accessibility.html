<p class="lead">We try our best to create an enjoyable experience for all players.</p>

<p>We approach things from an accessibility-first standpoint. Given that we're a text-based game, we've has always had a higher amount of sight-impaired players, as well as those with motor impairments (RSI, cerebral palsy, muscular dystropy, etc).</p>

<h2>Key Accessibility Features</h2>

<p>Shadowlack is built with consideration for screen readers and a wide range of assistive technology.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Keyboard Navigation</b>: You can navigate Shadowlack entirely with a keyboard.</li>
  <li><b>Touch-Screen Friendly</b>: Everything will work on your tablet or mobile device.</li>
  <li><b>Dark and Light Mode</b>: Both light and dark site themes are available to switch between. A theme switched can be found in the footer of the site.</li>
  <li><b>Dyslexia and Reading Disorders</b>: Shadowlack attempts to use your device's native font stack wherever possible.</li>
  <li><b>Screen Readers</b>: It is our hope that Shadowlack remains highly accessible for all screen reader technology, whether they be on a
  computer, tablet, or mobile device.</li>
  <li><b>Best Practices</b>: We try to follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/" rel="nofollow">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a> wherever it is possible.</li>
  <li><b>English as a Second Language</b>: Whether English is your second, third, or 12th language &ndash; you are welcome here. Learn, practise and improve upon your English.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Client Commands</h2>

<p>Screen reader mode is set at the session level, so it will need to be set every time that you connect. Though we hope to make this setting persistent.</p>
