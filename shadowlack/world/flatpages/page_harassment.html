<h2>Player Policy</h2>

<p>Shadowlack is dedicated to providing a harassment-free roleplaying experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
  gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Players asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
  comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a player engages in harassing behaviour, staff members may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  warning the offender, or banning from the game.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
  member of staff immediately.</p>

<p>We value your continued membership.</p>

<h2>Staff Policy</h2>

<h3>Issuing Warnings</h3>

<p>Any member of staff can issue a warning to a player that their behaviour violates the game's Anti-Harassment Policy.
</p>

<p>Warnings should be reported to <a href="mailto:graders@shadowlack.com">graders@shadowlack.com</a> as soon as
  practical. The report should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identifying information (character/username) of the warned player</li>
  <li>The time you issued the warning</li>
  <li>The behaviour that was in violation</li>
  <li>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning)</li>
  <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
  <li>Your identity</li>
  <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
</ol>

<h3>Taking Reports</h3>

<p>When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are
  being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the game will take. Ask for any other
  information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if
  they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing
  actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s).</p>

<p>If the reporter desires it, contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do
  not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially
  individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.</p>

<h3>Banning</h3>

<p>A player may be banned by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient.
  However, here are some general guidelines for when a player should be banned from the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction</li>
  <li>A pattern of harassing behaviour, with or without warnings</li>
  <li>A single serious offence</li>
  <li>A single obviously intentional offence</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.</p>

<h3>Issuing Public Statements</h3>

<p>As a general rule, staff members should not make any public statements about the behaviour of individuals at the
  game. In general, consult with other staff members when possible, but always act when necessary.</p>
