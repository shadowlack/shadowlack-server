<h2>Age</h2>
<p>It is <em>highly recommended</em> that you are thirteen years old or older to join this site, or have your parent's
  consent. Are you under thirteen and still wish to join? Please have your parents read our <a href="/parents/">Message
    for Parents and Teachers</a> and see what they have to say.</p>

<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>Any kind of disrespect or harassment in general is unwelcome here. Whether it be directed toward one of your peers or
  the game administration, through the <em>Forum</em>, <em>Chat Room</em> or through <em>PM</em> (Private Messages on
  the site). Out of character fights and quarrels will not be permitted on the boards. So if you have a problem with
  someone, please contact them outside of Shadowlack. Please read our <a href="#">Anti-Harassment
    Policy</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Violence and Language</h2>
<p>Swearing is allowed to a certain extent in order to emphasize points within roleplaying. There are many other
  intelligent ways to express anger and surprise that do not involve spouting off obscenities. Posts that include
  extreme violence, gore or language must be marked with an appropriate Thread Rating. Please see the <a
    href="#">Universal RPG Rating</a> page for more details.</p>

<h2>Accounts Per Person</h2>
<p>You are allowed to have one account per person. However, you may create multiple characters on that account.</p>

<h2>Character Naming Policy</h2>
<p>Types of names that are not acceptable and will result in your character being deleted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names that are not properly capitalized, contain netspeak, chatspeak, strange symbols, or phrases. (bess, 1337
    Dr4gon, Haywood Jablome, etc.)</li>
  <li>Names that contain profanity, something religious, or may otherwise offend or insult other members.</li>
  <li>Copyright or Trademarked names of products, services, characters, etc. (McDonalds, Crest, Harry Potter, Inu-Yasha,
    etc.)</li>
  <li>Names of celebrities, or famous people, past or present.</li>
  <li>Any other name that is deemed inappropriate by Shadowlack's Staff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Powerplaying and Invincibility</h2>
<p>Also known as, God-Moding, Auto-Hitting, Emoding, and Twinking. We'll have none of it! Your character can be
  killed, hurt, or even maimed badly for life. No character may be perfect or invincible. Try to roleplay as
  realistically as possible. You do not control the fate of other people's characters. Only you – and the game
  administration when it comes to extremes &#8211; can say what happens to your character. Meta-playing/Omniscience
  (your character having knowledge about another character that you as a roleplayer gained OOCly) is also not allowed.
</p>

<h2>Robots and Cyborgs</h2>

<p>You may not play or create a character that is a robot. This means that you may not play as a robotic character that
  is fully sentient, whether this be via artificial intelligence, or a machine that has been infused with a soul.</p>

<p>Cyborg characters, eg, characters with mechanical limbs, prosthetics, and the like, are allowed to some extent.
  However, if it is felt that your character is too extreme or twinkish (invincible; flawless; cannot be taken out by a
  single shotgun blast to the chest), armed with projectile weapons, or more weaponry than you can shake a stick at,
  your character will be rejected. Cyborgs that are allegedly created by the Ramathian military, other militant
  organization or cyborgs whose sole purpose in life is to <em>destroy things</em> are not allowed.</p>

<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>Hell yes. Shadowlack is based upon a futuristic fantasy society, so of course magic is allowed. If you're not sure if
  your certain type of magic is acceptable, contact the game owner. The source of all magic on Shadowlack is Fronima. It
  has a very mysterious nature but can be tamed and channeled through determination. To learn more about the nature of
  magic on Shadowlack, please read the <a href="#">Laws of Magic</a> page.</p>

<h2>Time Traveling</h2>
<p>Characters cannot time travel. There are no time machines, devices, etc.</p>

<h2>Post Length</h2>
<p>There is no posting minimum or maximum in regards to what length of your posts should be.</p>

<h2>Post Format and Timestamping</h2>
<p>Please include the character's name(s) that you are roleplaying either in the subject of the post or at the very
  beginning of the body. All threads should include a <a href="#">Timestamp</a> as well.
  Timestamping tells when your post takes place during the Ramathian timeline.</p>
<p>All posts should be written in <em>Third Person, Past Tense</em> (She jump<em>ed</em>).<br />
  <small>Writing in first person is also allowed, but is not recommended.</small></p>
