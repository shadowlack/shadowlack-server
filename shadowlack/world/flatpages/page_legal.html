  modifications, revisions, and changes made to it hereafter. If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not use

<h2>Site Content</h2>
<p>Shadowlack does contain mature content that may offend some viewers. Shadowlack is not a game created with a general
  or "child/kid" audience in mind, so viewer discretion is advised. Nudity, graphic violence, illegal acts, course
  language, drug usage, sexual acts, and other mature content may, on occasion, be found in role play posts. However,
  this content is purely fictional and occurs in Shadowlack's In Character forums only. Shadowlack expects its members
  to exercise maturity regarding these matters. Those found abusing the privilege to write about these mature acts, or
  using them in what may be considered "bad taste," or "not in a writing art form" by a Shadowlack Staff Member will
  have their post deleted and either be issued a written warning or have their account terminated. By viewing or
  participating in these role play threads, you agree that you are either of the legal age in your country to view and
  create such content, or that you have your parent or legal guardian's permission.</p>
<p>Please remember that we are not responsible for any messages or user content posted. We do not vouch for or warrant
  the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any message, and are not responsible for the contents of any message. The
  messages express the views of the author of the message, not necessarily the views of Shadowlack. Any user who feels
  that a posted message, character, or other site content, is objectionable, is encouraged to contact a Staff Member
  immediately by Personal Message ("PM"), electronic mail, or the contact form. We have the ability to remove
  objectionable messages and site content and we will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable time frame, if we
  determine that removal is necessary.</p>
