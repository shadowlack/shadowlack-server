Most notably, the Fey are smaller; on average and when fully-grown, quadrupeds are no bigger than the red fox of late Earth, and bipeds are no taller than 1.10 metres. Fey often refer to Pendragons as tall, even if the Pendragon in question is considered short by their peers.\n\nFey always have wings and tail-flames. Fey wings are one of the most varied parts of their appearance; wings that would be biologically impossible, yet are capable of working, are not uncommon.\n\nNearly all Fey sport special Fronima-infused tattoos, often related to their bloodlines.\n\nA Feydragon must have one of the following subtypes:\n\n1.) |gKynnyn|n and |gMongrel Kynnyn|n are the most common type of Fey and are the most integrated with Ramathian society. 80% of Feydragons are of this type. Kynnyn are generalists and hold no affinity to any particular element of magic. Due to their lack of specialization, they have the ability to become more powerful than any of the other Fey subtypes. Most Kynnyn are multi-talented and often take things that others view as hobbies or or pastimes competitively.\nMongrel Kynnyn are made up of hybrids and Fey from other groups who abandoned their heritage. The practice of sending such individuals to live in Kynnyn clans is an old one, going back thousands of years.\n\n2.) |gAlanamsul|n (elemental) are the second most common subtype of Feydragon and account for 11% of the Fey population. They are followers of the religion Tanalism and specifically worship the six elemental Numegola and refer to themselves as that deity's children. Every Alanamsul's appearance is influenced by its chosen Numegola. For example, a Child of Reda will primarily take on the appearance of fire.\n\n3.) |gAzetsum|n are known for their preternatural beauty and account for 6% of the Fey population. They are so divine in appearance that they are often called angels and are universally regarded as attractive by the Ramathian population. Some wonder if they were deliberately bred for physical appearance or passively charm all those around themselves.\nAzetsum are taller than all other types of Fey, and are much more muscular looking. They are always light in colour, and sometimes have darker markings (e.g. white with black stripes or spots). The wings of the Azetsum resemble those of giant feathered birds.\nAll this, along with a culture that centres largely on worship of Tanastlasei and Fromina, has given the Azetsum an image of kindly, noble, and beautiful \"divine champions\" who struggle for the continued existence of Ramath-lehi and its people.\n\n4.) |gMyshemd|n are the most misunderstood type of Fey and make up the remaining 4% of the population. As if they exist only to contrast the Azetsum, the Myshemd are nightmarish in appearance. These demon-like Fey are often stereotyped as evil and nihilistic worshippers of Kytlekh. Myshemd come in dark colours, and sometimes have light markings (e.g. dark red with acid yellow spots). Their wings come in two different varieties: males have bat-like webbed wings, while females have bat-wings that are covered in feathers.\n\n"

They are larger and weigh more than the average Pendragon due to their bone structure. Khellin have evolved to fit a very specific ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for extremely cold temperatures. They are insulated by several inches of blubber and have superbly dense underfur. Longer guard-hairs (up to 15 cm long for females and 40 cm for males) adorn their arms, legs, and ears, for extra warmth. It is not uncommon for Khellin to shave their fur when visiting or living in warmer climates, as they are prone to overheating in temperatures above 15 Â°C. When exposed to extremely cold temperatures, Khellin secrete special oils which makes their fur even less susceptible to frost. It is these oils that make their fur very soft and luxurious to the touch.\n\nKhellin are highly carnivorous and are unable to survive on a vegetarian diet.

Lukuo mutations are recessive in the genetic makeup, and therefore are not common, however as the Pendragon race continues to evolve, certain mutations become more common over time. Lukuo genes need to be triggered in some way to appear in progeny, either by another Lukuo recessive gene in the other parent, or in the absence of a gene, in which case the mutation will surface, because there is no dominant gene to suppress it.\n\nLukuo are identified by any number of extra or multiple body decorations. These include multiple limbs and tails, any number and type of horns on their skull, or bone spikes manifesting themselves anywhere on the body, but most commonly along the spine, shoulder blades, elbows, and ankles. Wings are a growing common sight among Pendragons, but multiple wings, often one atop the other, or one pair in front of another pair also denote a Lukuo. (Often one pair is smaller than the other.)

So it is not uncommon to see a green Pendragon, or even one with rainbow-coloured stripes. Their body structure is similar to that of a wolf, although entwined with a lot of feline attributes - some even look a lot like Earth's big cats, or even like true mythological dragons. They usually have hair growing from the top of their heads that sometimes slinks down their backs like soft spikes, or even bladed hair.\n\nIn terms of physiological differences between the sexes, there are not very many. Both male and female Pendragons are capable of telepathic thought-speak (sending messages into each other's minds). This is not the prefered method of communication, but it is still used, nonetheless. However, male Pendragons commonly carry flames at the end of their tails although finding this mutation in females is not extremely rare. These flames are often reflective of a Pendragon's mood or strength.\n\nMost Pendragons are marked with tattoos, usually on their left haunch, although sometimes on the right. These are symbols that their parents thought would reflect the young Pendragon's personality. Usually the parents consult a seer or someone else of that nature in order to gain insight as to what a Pendragon's symbol should be. Some players like to make up random designs for their character's tattoo, or even base them off of a specific creature or object."

Their hands are large and made up of two thick fingers and an opposable thumb. All fingers have wicked two-inch claws on them that can be re-grow if broken and are very helpful for climbing trees and stone surfaces.

        self.desc = "|gYki|n thrive in the bitter north. Adept masters of the terrains they frequent, these northern Pendragons do not need the advanced technology used throughout the more southern climates to thrive and live comfortably.\n\nThe Yki (a name given by those learnt Pendragons who first discovered the natives of Dhruv) tend to be small and fox-like at first glance. Their pelts consist of a thick, downy undercoat that traps heat against the body and a long, wiry outer coat that is made up of hollow hairs that capture and retain heat. They have large ears, but their hair grows especially long around them, sheltering the sensitive organs from frostbite. The Yki are also able to fold back their ears, tucking them into the thick fur of the back of their head if needed; their ears are incredibly flexible, thanks to well-formed muscles at their bases. The leather of their noses is almost always black, the only individuals with pink or pale nose leather being albinos and half-Yki. Yki paws are adapted for travel over slick and cold surfaces; their paw-pads have â€˜treadsâ€™, raised ridges that are unique to each individual. Yki claws are long and hook-like, perfect for snaring a meal or gripping slippery ice. Between their toes grows long, course hair that protects the feet from the elements. The lower portion of their legs also has longer fur, although it is the same fur that is found all over the body.\n\nIt has been found that Yki introduced to warmer climates will moult their outer coat, leaving only the incredibly thick and luxurious undercoat. When reintroduced to their homelands, the Yki will re-grow the outer coat within a matter of days.\n\nThe Yki always have white coats, with a secondary color for markings, hair, and tail flame (in males). Occasionally a male will be born with a black base instead of white, but this is a rare occurrence; it happens no more than 1 in 100 births. If a single kit in a litter bears a black coat, chances are it's litter-mates will as well. The only exception to the white/black base rule is half-Yki, who's pelt colour may be affected by their non-Yki parent.\n\nThere is a particular hereditary gene found in a few Yki families, particularity the Jori and Tuggheja clans. The gene is recessive, and carried by the female, although it only seems to manifest itself in males. It affects the Yki's secondary colour, reversing the pelts colors so that the secondary colour overwhelms the white base. To all appearances the affected Yki seems to be a reverse of a normal individual, with white markings on a colour base instead of the opposite.\n\nWings are a common trait amongst the Yki, but only feathered wings are seen. Scaled or bat-like wings (thin skin covered by short fur) are unsuitable for the arctic environment they inhabit. Half-Yki may occasionally defy this rule, but it's rare for them to survive on their own, depending on their family; as the amount of exposed skin on their wings can prove hazardous to their health, and often fatal.\n\nTribes identify each other by facial tattoos, given when a kit turns five. These tattoos are unique to each tribe, and are added to as the Yki matures; given in recognition of specific events, much like the grading process in use in other parts of the world. A few of the more southern tribes grow out their fur and hair and wear it in dreadlocks, and then adored with beads and other ornaments made of coloured stones or metal."
